/**
 * SimpleStreamSampler is a sampler with a fixed sample size. Once the sampler is full, when a new point is submitted
 * to the sampler decision is made to accept or reject the new point. If the point is accepted, then an older point
 * is removed from the sampler. This class implements time-based reservoir sampling, which means that newer points are
 * given more weight than older points in the randomized decision.
 * <p>
 * The sampler algorithm is an example of the general weighted reservoir sampling algorithm, which works like this:
 *
 * <ol>
 *     <li>
 *         For each item i choose a random number u(i) uniformly from the interval (0, 1) and compute the weight
 *         function <tt>-(1 / c(i)) * log u(i)</tt>, for a given coefficient function c(i).
 *     </li>
 *     <li>
 *         For a sample size of N, maintain a list of the N items with the smallest weights.
 *     </li>
 *     <li>
 *         When a new item is submitted to sampler, compute its weight. If it is smaller than the largest weight
 *         currently contained in the sampler, then the item with the largest weight is evicted from the sample and
 *         replaced by the new item.
 *     </li>
 * </ol>
 * <p>
 * The SimpleStreamSampler creates a time-decayed sample by using the coefficient function:
 * <tt>c(i) = exp(lambda * sequenceIndex(i))</tt>.

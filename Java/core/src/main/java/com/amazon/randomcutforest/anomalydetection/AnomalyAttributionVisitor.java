/**
 * Attribution exposes the attribution of scores produced by ScalarScoreVisitor
 * corresponding to different attributes. It allows a boolean
 * ignoreClosestCandidate; which when true will compute the attribution as it
 * that near neighbor was not present in RCF. This is turned on by default for
 * duplicate points seen by the forest, so that the attribution does not change
 * is a sequence of duplicate points are seen. For non-duplicate points, if the
 * boolean turned on, reduces effects of masking (when anomalous points are
 * included in the forest (which will be true with a few samples or when the
 * samples are not refreshed appropriately). It is worth remembering that
 * disallowing anomalous points from being included in the forest forest
 * explicitly will render the algorithm incapable of adjusting to a new normal
 * -- which is a strength of this algorithm.

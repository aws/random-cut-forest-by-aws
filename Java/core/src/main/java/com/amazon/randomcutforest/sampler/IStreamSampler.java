/**
 * <p>
 * A sampler that can be updated iteratively from a stream of data points. The
 * update operation is broken into two steps: an "accept" step and an "add"
 * step. During the "accept" step, the sampler decides whether to accept a new
 * point into sample. The decision rule will depend on the sampler
 * implementation If the sampler is full, accepting a new point requires the
 * sampler to evict a point currently in the sample. This operation is also part
 * of the accept step.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * If the outcome of the accept step is to accept a new point, then the sampler
 * continues to the second step to add a point to the sample (if the outcome is
 * not to accept a new point, then this step is not invoked). The reason for
 * this two-step process is because sampler update steps may be interleaved with
 * model update steps in
 * {@link com.amazon.randomcutforest.executor.IUpdatable#update} (see
 * {@link com.amazon.randomcutforest.executor.SamplerPlusTree#update}, for
 * example). In particular, if a new point is accepted into the sampler whose
 * value is equal to an existing point in the sample, then the model may choose
 * to increment the count on the existing point rather than allocate new storage
 * for the duplicate point.
 * </p>
 *
 * @param <P> The point type.

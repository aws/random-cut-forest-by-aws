/**
 * A DiVector is used when we want to track a quantity in both the positive and
 * negative directions for each dimension in a manifold. For example, when using
 * a {@link AnomalyAttributionVisitor} to compute the attribution of the anomaly
 * score to dimension of the input point, we want to know if the anomaly score
 * attributed to the ith coordinate of the input point is due to that coordinate
 * being unusually high or unusually low.
 *
 * The DiVectorState creates a POJO to be used in serialization.

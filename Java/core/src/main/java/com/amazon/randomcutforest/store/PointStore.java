 * PointStore is a fixed size repository of points, where each point is a float

 * The primary use of this store is to enable compression since the points in
 * two different trees do not have to be stored separately.
 *
 * Stored points are referenced by index values which can be used to look up the
 * point values and increment and decrement reference counts. Valid index values

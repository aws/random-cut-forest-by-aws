/**
 * This abstract visitor encodes a standard method for computing a scalar result
 * value. The basic computation is as follows:
 *
 * <ol>
 * <li>After following the traversal path to a leaf, compute a base score at the
 * leaf node.</li>
 * <li>For each node in the traversal path from the leaf to the root, compute
 * the probability that a random cut would separate the query point from the
 * node. The updated score uses this probability to create a weighted
 * combination between the current score and a score contribution from the
 * current node.</li>
 * </ol>
 * <p>
 * While this basic algorithm produces good results when all the points in the
 * sample are distinct, it can produce unexpected results when a significant
 * portion of the points in the sample are duplicates. Therefore this class
 * supports different optional features for modifying the score produced when
 * the point being scored is equal to the leaf node in the traversal.

/**
 * A fixed-size buffer for storing interior tree nodes. An interior node is
 * defined by its location in the tree (parent and child nodes), its random cut,
 * and its bounding box. The NodeStore class uses arrays to store these field
 * values for a collection of nodes. An index in the store can be used to look
 * up the field values for a particular node.
 *
 * If we think of an array of Node objects as being row-oriented (where each row
 * is a Node), then this class is analogous to a column-oriented database of
 * Nodes.
 *
 * Note that a NodeStore does not store instances of the
 * {@link com.amazon.randomcutforest.tree.Node} class.

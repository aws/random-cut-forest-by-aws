/**
 * <p>
 * CompactSampler is an implementation of time-based reservoir sampling. When a
 * point is submitted to the sampler, the decision to accept the point gives
 * more weight to newer points compared to older points. The newness of a point
 * is determined by its sequence index, and larger sequence indexes are
 * considered newer.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The sampler algorithm is an example of the general weighted reservoir
 * sampling algorithm, which works like this:
 * </p>
 * <ol>
 * <li>For each item i choose a random number u(i) uniformly from the interval
 * (0, 1) and compute the weight function <code>-(1 / c(i)) * log u(i)</code>,
 * for a given coefficient function c(i).</li>
 * <li>For a sample size of N, maintain a list of the N items with the smallest
 * weights.</li>
 * <li>When a new item is submitted to sampler, compute its weight. If it is
 * smaller than the largest weight currently contained in the sampler, then the
 * item with the largest weight is evicted from the sample and replaced by the
 * new item.</li>
 * </ol>
 * <p>
 * The coefficient function used by CompactSampler is:
 * <code>c(i) = exp(lambda * sequenceIndex(i))</code>.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Note that the sampling algorithm used is the same as for
 * {@link SimpleStreamSampler}. The difference is that CompactSampler is
 * specialized to use Integers as the point reference type and the
 * implementation uses less runtime memory.
 * </p>
